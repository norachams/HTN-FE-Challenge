# HTN-FE-Challenge

## To open the project üòÅ
- cd into the directory
- npm install
- npm start
- Access at http://localhost:3000


## Developement Process:

- To plan out the structure and design of the project, I began by carefully reviewing the project requirements and breaking down the necessary features into smaller, more manageable tasks. I then created a rough sketch of the application layout and identified the different components that would be needed. In terms of tools, I chose React for the frontend and CSS for styling.

- As I worked on the project, I encountered a few challenges. For example, I had difficulty getting the private and public events to display properly when users were logged in. Unfortunately, I was not able to fully implement the login functionality within the given time frame.Another challenge was working with the API data and mapping it to the components. I was able to solve these issues through careful debugging and troubleshooting.

- One aspect of the project that I am particularly proud of is the CSS styling for the events. I was able to create a gradient background with a grainy texture that gives the events a unique and visually appealing look.

- If I had additional time, I would focus on implementing the login functionality and adding additional features to enhance the overall user experience. For example, I might consider adding more search and filtering options, as well as performance metrics to ensure that the application can handle large volumes of traffic.


## Extending application
A feature I would add in order to make the application to become a fully functional product is the ability for users to create and save their own schedule of events they want to attend. This would require implementing user authentication and authorization, as well as a database to store user data. I would also add performance metrics to track the speed and efficiency of the application, as well as implement caching to reduce API calls and improve load times.


## Given additional time

Overall, I enjoyed working on this project and learning more about React and CSS. While I wasn't able to fully implement the login functionality, I think the application still provides a good user experience with the ability to view events. If I had more time, I would definitely work on adding the login functionality to improve the user experience and security of the application.
