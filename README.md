## Developement Process:

To plan out the structure and design of the project, I started by reading the requirements and breaking down the features into smaller, more manageable tasks. I then sketched out a rough layout of the application and the different components that would be needed. From there, I decided on the tools I would use, including React for the frontend and CSS for styling. Building this I encountered many problems, some of which I solved and other which I didnt have the time to fix. One of them is getting the private and public events to show when logged in. One of the problems was with the API data and mapping the data to the components, but I was able to solve them with some debugging and troubleshooting. I'm particularly proud of the CSS styling for the events, as I was able to create a gradient background with a grainy texture.



## Given additional time

Overall, I enjoyed working on this project and learning more about React and CSS. While I wasn't able to fully implement the login functionality, I think the application still provides a good user experience with the ability to view events. If I had more time, I would definitely work on adding the login functionality to improve the user experience and security of the application.
